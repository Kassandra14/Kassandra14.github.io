It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

__tests__/			// jest tests
  Employee.test.js
  Engineer.test.js
  Intern.test.js
  Manager.test.js

The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.
